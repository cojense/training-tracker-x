feat(sync): Complete final parity and stabilize API layer

- Stabilized development environment with mock OAuth and project-relative paths.
- Fixed critical API gaps for Projects (added GET/PUT) and Groups (added member list).
- Resolved CORS preflight 404s by removing duplicate /api blueprint prefix.
- Fixed 500 errors in Group details by handling optional/null suspense dates in DB row parsing.
- Improved database initialization with automatic seeding of hierarchical test data.
