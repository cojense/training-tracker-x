feat(infra): Standardize native startup and remove host-specific paths

- Updated run.bash to use project-relative paths and detect .venv/ correctly.
- Enhanced docker-compose.yml with automatic database initialization and seeding.
- Added comprehensive_seed.sql for deep testing of manager/supervisor hierarchies.
- Resolved macOS/Docker volume contention by making SQLite WAL mode optional.
