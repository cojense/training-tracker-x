feat(dev): Stabilize development environment and database initialization

- Updated config.py to provide mock OAuth credentials in development mode.
- Modified db.py to make SQLite WAL mode optional (fixes 'unable to open database' on macOS).
- Enhanced docker-compose.yml with automatic database initialization and comprehensive seeding.
- Created comprehensive_seed.sql with hierarchical test data (Justin -> Bob -> Charlie/David).
- Updated Dockerfile to include sqlite3 and required directories in the deploy stage.
